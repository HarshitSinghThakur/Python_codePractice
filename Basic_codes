In Python, a placeholder is a special symbol or syntax used to represent a value or variable that will be replaced with an actual value at runtime. Placeholders are typically used within strings to create 
formatted output or messages. The most commonly used placeholders in Python are curly braces {} which are used in conjunction with the format method or formatted string literals (f-strings) to insert values 
into a string.

E.g   ---Curly Braces {} with format method:   """
